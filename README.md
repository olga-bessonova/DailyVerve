# Technologies Used
## MERN Stack
The application utilizes the MERN Stack - a combination of MongoDB, Express.js, React.js and Node.js. This framework choice facilitated the use of Javascript for both the front and back end. The MongoDB stores the user's information and recorded history as NoSQL objects, while the Node.js scripts are responsible for posting and fetching this data, which is subsequently displayed on the React frontend.
- Languages: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
